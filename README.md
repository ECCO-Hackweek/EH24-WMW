# 🌊🧍‍♀️🌊 WMW 🌊🧍‍♀️🌊
WMW = water mass women, women of mode waters, women of water mass, etc.

## Introduction
Exploring and understanding how ECCO represents water masses in the Southern Ocean.

### Collaborators
Sarah Zhang, Isba Keshwani, Ian Fenty, Gaël Forget, Ichiro Fukumori

### Goal
Understanding the consequences of Antarctic sea ice change, especially amidst recent extremes, is important for understanding global ocean circulation. Therefore, we evaluate if ECCO accurately represents water masses and their volumes correctly. Specifically, we delve into Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and its volume over time.
